Arunachal Pradesh is a paradise for those who love to nature, also for adventure enthusiasts. Ideal especially for trekking, you hardly come across people or see any vehicles as you navigate through the roads that connect some of the most beautiful and remote villages in the easternmost part of India.

In Arunachal Pradesh, almost everywhere you stop is an ideal place to set up a campsite and have a peaceful time. It is that beautiful! One such spot is Glow Lake, nestled among the forests of Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary.

Below are a few pictures from a trek to Glow Lake:
